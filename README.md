# MyWebsite

In general, in November, I decided to redo the entire project, as I was not satisfied with it. Completely changed the HTML, CSS.
A little JS was added, but not much. 
At the moment, I'm studying it, since I'm not at a very good level. 
Various features and other JS things will appear in the next few days. Because I'm still working on them.
Here's a link to my website - https://nikplay32.github.io/MyWebsite/ 
For some reason, it does not show the background of the main section - home. I have not figured out this problem yet. As it really looks like you can see in the file - Home_Page.png  
UPD: error with image was fixed
